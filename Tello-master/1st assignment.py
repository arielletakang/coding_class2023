# TRY THE FOLLOWING
# ASSIGN THESE NUMBERS TO VARIABLES
# TRY THREE TYPES F MATH WITH SAID VARIABLES: ADDITION, SUBTRACTION, DIVISION
# ASSIGN NEW NUMBERS TO SAID VARIABLES ONCE UR DONE
# NAME EVERYTHING DIFF THAN MAURA DID
# ADD, SUBTRACT, AND MULTIPLY IN LISTS

# VARIABLES I USED
a = 2
b = 6
c = 8

# THE RESULT OF A BEING USED
aResult = (a+a) * (a+b)
#PRINTING A'S VALUE
print(aResult)
bResult = (b+b) * (b+c)
# PRINTING B'S VALUE
print(bResult)
cResult = (c+c) * (c+b)
print(cResult)
first_example = (aResult + bResult + cResult)
print(first_example)


# INDEX & LIST EXAMPLE
robin = (7,11,3)
A = robin[0]
B = robin[1]
Answer = (A + B)
print(Answer)

#TRYING CONDITIONS
#Make a conditional statement that keeps adding a variable to "Answer"
#Until it reaches a certian number
